\article{Rules for Voting and Debate}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Upon entering debate, a queue will be established and maintained by the Parliamentarian.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The queue determines who has the floor to speak. The Parliamentarian is responsible for acknowledging all those who wish to speak, and must announce each speaker before their speaking time begins.

    \item Total debate time is unbounded by default.

    \item Speaking time defaults to five minutes.

    \item Anyone present in the room has the right to speak, and may speak any number of times.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Those who have not spoken will be called upon before those who have spoken.
        \item If the queue is on the topic of a presentation, designated presenters may respond to any questions directed at them. Speaking time limits still apply.
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Queues for any motion will proceed until the motion has left the floor. Other queues may be ended by the presiding officer when empty.

    \item A Senator may move to restrict the queue, requiring a second and majority approval.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item By default, only members of the Senate, Officers, and Committee Chairs may be added to a restricted queue. Additional individuals to be given queue rights may be specified by the Senator moving to restrict the queue.
        \item If an individual without queue rights wishes to speak during a restricted queue, they will not be called upon until no members with queue rights remain on the queue.
    \end{enumerate}

    \item A Senator may move to close the queue, requiring a second and a $\frac{2}{3}$ vote.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item No additional individuals may be added to a closed queue.
    \end{enumerate}

    \item A Senator may move to reopen a closed or restricted queue, requiring a second and a majority vote.

   \item When speaking time is limited, speakers can yield their time in the following ways:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Yield to the Chair, forfeiting their time, or
        \item Yield to another speaker, transferring their time to another person in the room. That person may decline to speak, forfeiting their time.
    \end{enumerate}

    \item A yielded speaker may not yield time further.
\end{enumerate}

\item All voting shall be by a show of hands, unless a Senator, Officer, Committee Chairperson, or the presiding officer requests a roll call vote;
\begin{enumerate}
    \item In a show of hands, the presiding officer will request the number in favor, the number opposed, and finally the number of abstentions, in that order. The presiding officer will then announce the vote, and whether the motion has passed. In the event of a tie, the presiding officer may then announce their vote followed by the outcome;
    \item The Parliamentarian will also carry out a count of votes to verify the announced result of a vote;
    \item If a roll call vote is requested, the Secretary will read the names of the Senators alphabetically by surname. If the Grand Marshal is included in the voting population, he or she will be called last;
    \item Each Senator may vote yes, no, or pass. If they pass, their name will be read again after the first completion of the roll call. At this time, the Senator must vote or abstain; and
    \item No vote may be determined, nor any result announced, until all Senators present have voted or abstained.
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
